# About

Roc is a modern, fast, and safe programming language designed for building reliable software with simplicity in mind. With an emphasis on performance and minimalism, Roc brings a fresh perspective to the world of functional programming, aiming to make it accessible and efficient for developers.

## Main Features

- **Simplicity and Safety**: Roc is designed to reduce common programming errors through its type system and by enforcing immutability by default, which leads to more predictable and maintainable code.
- **Optimized Performance**: Roc's compiler is built to generate highly optimized machine code, ensuring that applications run fast and efficiently.
- **No Nonsense Dependencies**: Roc encourages simplicity not just in code, but also in dependency management, aiming for minimal external dependencies.
- **Clean Syntax**: Roc's syntax is straightforward and easy to read, drawing inspiration from modern functional languages while stripping away unnecessary complexity.
- **Interoperability**: Roc is built to work well with other languages, making it easier to integrate into existing projects.

## History and Creators

Roc was created by Richard Feldman, a developer with a strong background in the Elm language. Feldman aimed to bring the benefits of functional programming, such as safety and simplicity, to a broader audience, while also addressing the limitations he observed in existing languages. Roc has grown through a community-driven development process, with contributions from developers who share a passion for clean, reliable software.
